🤝 Trade-offs


🔥 Firebase 

I used Firebase because it seemed like the quickest way to set up a database. 
The downside is that it is a noSQL database 
so I needed to use more js to sort Fields in order to be able to build generic components. 
In production I would have used a SQL database and data models or use an Apollo server and graphQL. 
I would have stored each part of the address separately. 

 
✨ CSS
I used base Tailwind styles



🪄 Used the Fetch API instead of axios library because I didn't need interceptors or other functionality. 


DAWA API
In production I would have choosen a different UI library or build a complex combobox component and grab the whole Object from the DAWA API 
instead of just the address value. Because of this the Form validation is a bit simple.
