Firebase 

I used Firebase so to make Components reusable I needed to use more js than with SQL database and data models
 but I wanted to set up the database fast. 


CSS

I like Tailwind looks but too much CSS in HTML
Chakra for eg might have been a better choice. 
In React world there are nothing like Quasar or Vuetify. Check out their autocompletes and cry
